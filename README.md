# Frogs
WindowsFormsApplication

The project is created - the practice of working with pictures.

The goal of the game is to place the left-facing frogs on the left side and the rest of the frogs on the right side in the minimum number of jumps.
You can jump on a leaf if it is next to or through 1 frog
 
 I have performed the following tasks:
1) Make a menu
2) Start over
3) Show rules
4) When winning, write optimality (whether the user could win for fewer jumps)
